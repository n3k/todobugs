# todobugs: a secure ToDo list application

## Purpose

This is a weekend project created for the cybersecurity fundamentals course given at the UTN FRRe.

## Notes

Need to work on the automatic deploy of statics... I did `python manage.py collectstatics` and manually copied the content into the project root/nginx/ so that nginx Dockerfile could initialize what's needed.
